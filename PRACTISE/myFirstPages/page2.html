    <h4>Alpine Skiing in Åre, Sweden</h4>
    <p>
        Alpine Skiing in Åre: Green, blue, red, black pistes. Park, forest, off-piste. T-bars, chairlifts, gondolas
        topped with a cable car. Åre has 42 ski lifts and 89 slopes + 890 meters vertical drop = a lot of skiing in
        Skandinavia’s largest and best ski resort ✌
    <p>
        If you want to go skiing in northern Europe there is really no reason to go anywhere but Åre. Even if we strive
        to avoid clichés such as “this is where you’ll find something for everyone”, this is one occasion when we
        actually do have to use them. Because Åre truly offers something for everyone. From conveyor belts to World
        Championship approved slopes, to challenging off-piste to gigantic jumps in the parks. You just need to find
        your favorite spot.
