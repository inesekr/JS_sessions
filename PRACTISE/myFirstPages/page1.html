    <h4>Rota Vicentina - The Fisherman's trail, Portugal</h4>
    <h6>750 KM TO HIKE THROUGHOUT THE REGION</h2>
        <p>
            Rota Vicentina’s network of walking trails has gradually evolved, spreading today throughout this
            magnificent
            region of the Alentejo and Vicentine coast. While the coastal trails are truly breathtaking, so are the many
            paths that extend through fields and mountain ranges further into the interior, areas that have been
            overlooked
            by tourism for a long time but that nonetheless deserve to be appreciated by hikers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Historical Way e the Fishermen’s Trail and the Circular Routes, offer an increasingly complete network
            of
            trails, with greater variety and flexibility, to be adjusted to the needs and expectations of all different
            types of hikers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The experienced hiker who goes from north to south without hesitation, the family that adjusts to the rhythm
            of
            the children, the curious hikers and those who might just be finding their feet will find many different
            possibilities for combining these trails to create the routes that best suit them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Welcome to some of the best hiking trails in the world, and have a great hike!
